<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">New Features ‚ú®</h2>

1. [#144](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CASL/issues/144) - Change the `Sound` class from `sealed` to unsealed.
   > **Note** This gives users the ability to inherit from the sound class to make it easier to adapt for their own systems.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Breaking Changes üß®</h2>

1. [#120](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CASL/issues/120) - Introduced the following breaking changes:
   - Changed the return type of the `AudioDevices` property in the `AudioDevice` class from `string[]` to `ImmutableArray<string>`.
   - Removed access to the `OggAudioDataStream` class by internalizing the type.
     > **Note** This class was not meant to be exposed as part of the public API.
   - Refactored the following exceptions from being unsealed to sealed.
     - `AudioException`
     - `SoundDataException`
     - `AudioDeviceDoestNotExistException`
     - `AudioDeviceManagerNotInitializedException`
   - `InitializeDeviceException`
     - `LoadLibraryException`
     - `StringNullOrEmptyException`
     - `UnknownPlatformException`
2. [#120](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CASL/issues/120) - Made the following improvements:
   - Made all of the custom exceptions in the code base serializable.
        > **Note** This is best practice as it makes it much easier for multiple systems to consume and utilize the exceptions.
   - Changed how interoperability works with the native OpenAL libraries.
        > **Note** Interop was changed from the classic `[DllImport]` system to the new `[LibraryImport]` system introduced  
        > in dotnet v7.0.  This comes with performance benefits as well as allowing to be AOT compiled for systems that do not allow dynamic code generation. Go [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/native-interop/pinvoke-source-generation) for more information.
