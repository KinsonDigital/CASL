<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center" >!! NOTICE !!</h2>

This library is still under development and has not reached v1.0.0 yet and is currently under preview.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">üìñ About CASL</h2>

Pronounced _Castle_, **CASL** is an acronym for (C)ross-platform (A)udio and (S)ound (L)ibrary

**CASL** is a simplistic cross-platform, .NET library for playing and managing sounds powered by **OpenAL 1.1** using software rendering. This is accomplished by using low level bindings to the native **OpenAL** library.

This can be used for applications such as video games, sound players, and works on any **.NET 5.0** compliant platform.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">‚ú®Features</h2>

### Audio Formats

Currently this library can play **.ogg** and **.mp3** file formats. There are plans to support **.wav** files in the future as well as other possible sound formats.

### Cross-Platform

We strive for **CASL** to be a cross platform library by running under **.NET v5.0**. There are plans for this library to continually be updated as we approach **.NET 6.0** and beyond.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">üîßMaintainers</h2>

We currently have the following maintainers:

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">üìÑDocumentation</h2>

- Goto the [Table Of Contents](./Documentation/TableOfContents.md) for instructions on various things such as the branching, release process, environment setup and more.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">üôèüèºContributing</h2>

**CASL** encourages and uses [Early Pull Requests](https://medium.com/practical-blend/pull-request-first-f6bb667a9b6). Please don't wait until you're finished with your work before creating a PR.

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch following the feature branch section in the documentation [here](./Documentation/Branching.md)
3. Add an empty commit to the new feature branch to start your work off.
   - Use this git command: `git commit --allow-empty -m "start of [thing you're working on]"`
4. Once you've pushed a commit, open a [**draft pull request**](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). Do this **before** you start working.
5. Make your commits in small, incremental steps with clear descriptions.
6. All unit tests must pass before a PR will be completed.
7. Make sure that the code follows the the coding standards.
   - Pay attention to the warnings in **Visual Studio**!!
   - Refer to the _.editorconfig_ files in the code base for rules
8. Tag a maintainer when you're done and ask for a review!

If you have any questions, contact a project maintainer

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Practices</h2>

1. The code base is highly tested using unit testing with a high level of code coverage. When contributing, make sure to add or adjust the unit tests appropriately regarding your changes.
2. We use a combination of [StyleCop](https://github.com/DotNetAnalyzers/StyleCopAnalyzers) and [Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.NetAnalyzers](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn-analyzers) libraries for maintaining coding standards.
   - We understand that there are some exceptions to the rule and not all coding standards fit every situation. In these scenarios, contact a maintainer and lets discuss it!! Warnings can always be suppressed if need be.

- We use [semantic versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) for versioning.

<h2 style="font-weight:bold" align="center">Further Resources</h2>

- A sample project **CASLTesting** can be found in the [Testing Folder](https://github.com/KinsonDigital/CASPL/tree/master/Testing/CASLTesting)
  - This project serves the purpose of a sample project as well as a simple way to do manual testing of the library
- Goto [OpenAL](https://www.openal.org/) for more information and documentation.
- Checkout [NVorbis](https://github.com/NVorbis/NVorbis) for dealing with **.ogg** data.
- Checkout [MP3Sharp](https://github.com/ZaneDubya/MP3Sharp) for dealing with **.mp3** data.
