- [ ] PR title matches the example below but with proper version
  * **Example:** ðŸš€Release To Preview - v1.2.3.preview.4
- [ ] The **_[add version here]_** text in the PR description replaced with the version.
- [ ] Issue[s] exists and is linked to this PR.
- [ ] This PR is only for bringing changes from a **_non-version-release_** branch into a **_version-release_** branch
    - ðŸ’¡ A version-release branch is the branch used for preview releases and has a syntax of **_release/v1.2.3_**
    - ðŸ’¡ A non-version-release is a branch prefixed with **_release/_** and does NOT have a version after the **_release/_** section.  Non version release branches bring changes to a prerelease.
- [ ] My code follows the code style of this project.
- [ ] All tests passed locally.
  - ðŸ’¡ Status checks are put in place to run unit tests every single time a change is pushed to a PR.  This does not mean that the tests pass in both the local and CI environment.
- [ ] Update library version by updating the **_\<Version/\>_** and **_\<FileVersion/\>_** tags in the **_.csproj_** file.
  - ðŸ’¡ Every change to a PR will run a status check to confirm that the version has the correct syntax and does not already exist in the repository.
  - ðŸ’¡ Make sure to add the **_.preview.\<number\>_** syntax to the end of the version
    - **Example:**
      ``` html
      <Version>1.2.3.preview.4</Version>
      <FileVersion>1.2.3.preview.4</FileVersion>
      ```
- [ ] A **_preview_** label has been added to the PR
